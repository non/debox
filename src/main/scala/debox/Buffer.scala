/**
 * Buffer is a mutable, indexed sequence of values.
 *
 * Buffer wraps an underlying array, which provides constant-time
 * lookups, updates, and length checks. Values can be appended to or
 * popped from the end of the buffer in amortized constant time. Other
 * operations, such as insert, prepend, and will be linear.
 *
 * In cases where the type A is known (or the caller is specialized on
 * A), Buffer[A] will store the values in an unboxed array, and will
 * not box values on access or update. To aid in specialization and to
 * avoid inheriting bogus methods, Buffer intentionally does not
 * implement any of Scala's collection traits.
 *
 * For interop purposes, the toIterable method wraps a buffer in a
 * collections-compatible Iterable[A]. Buffer's iterator method
 * returns an Iterator[A], and the conversion methods .toArray,
 * toVector, and toList are also available.
 *
 * To facilitate inlining, Buffer's internals are public. However, you
 * should refrain from accessing or modifying these values unless you
 * know what you are doing.
 *
 * Furthermore, since Buffer is really only useful in cases where you
 * care about space efficiency and performance, Buffer declines to do
 * error-checking above what is provided by the underlying array, or
 * which is necessary to avoid corruption. This means that if you try
 * to access an element beyond the Buffer's length, you are not
 * guaranteed to get an exception (although you will in many
 * cases). This is by design. However, calls which modify the buffer
 * using an invalid index are guaranteed not to corrupt the buffer.
 *
 * Finally, there is no attempt made to provide any kind of thread
 * safety or protection against concurrent updates. Modify a Buffer
 * during foreach, map, iterator, etc will produce undefined results.
